# Osteoporosis-Detection-on-Hips-X-Ray-Dataset-using-InceptionNet-ResNet-50-YOLOv7-and-YOLOv8
Osteoporosis is a disease of bone characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of fracture. This project includes Osteoporosis detection using AI and Deep Learning algorithms for accurate diagnosis and prediction of osteoporosis.

This repo employs deep learning algorithms to detect osteoporosis using X-ray modalities to find obscure, possibly invisible aspects in an X-ray. On the hips X-ray dataset, this study applies four deep learning models (ResNet-50, InceptionNet, YOLO v7, and Ultralytics YOLO v8). In the YOLOv8 model, where 98.8 mAP was recorded, the model accuracy was at its peak.
